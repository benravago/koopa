If we can find the matching copybook then its contents should be included.
Given that there are matching replacements defined, the contents of the
copybook will appear modified.


< ONE.
< COPY "MOVES" REPLACING ==XXX== BY ==FOO== ==YYY== BY ==FUM==.
< ADD 1 TO XXX YYY ZZZ.

> ONE.
> MOVE 11 TO FOO.
>MOVE 22 TO FUM.
>MOVE 33 TO ZZZ.
> ADD 1 TO XXX YYY ZZZ.

Note that replacements end with the copybook.

< TWO.
< COPY "MOVES" REPLACING ==YYY== BY ==FUM== ==ZZZ== BY ==FEE==.
< ADD 1 TO XXX YYY ZZZ.

> TWO.
> MOVE 11 TO XXX.
>MOVE 22 TO FUM.
