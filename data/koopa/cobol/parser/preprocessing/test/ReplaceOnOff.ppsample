This exercises activation and explicit deactivation of a single REPLACE.


Default state has no active replacements.
< MOVE 11 TO XXX.
> MOVE 11 TO XXX.



Here we activate one, then cancel it a bit later.
< REPLACE ==XXX== BY ==FOO==.
< MOVE 22 TO XXX.
< REPLACE OFF.
< MOVE 33 TO XXX.

Which should expand to:
> 
> MOVE 22 TO FOO.
> 
> MOVE 33 TO XXX.
