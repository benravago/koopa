This exercises activation and explicit deactivation of a single REPLACE.
But now twice in a row.


Default state has no active replacements.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE XXX TO YYY.



Here we activate one, then cancel it a bit later.
< REPLACE ==XXX== BY ==FOO==.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
< REPLACE OFF.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.

Which should expand to:
> 
> MOVE FOO TO YYY.
> 
> MOVE XXX TO YYY.



Here we activate another one, then cancel it a bit later.
< REPLACE ==YYY== BY ==FUM==.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
< REPLACE OFF.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.

Which should expand to:
> 
> MOVE XXX TO FUM.
> 
> MOVE XXX TO YYY.
