This tests the absence of any preprocessing directives.
I'm also using it as a way to show the structure of these test files.

Lines starting with a '<' define the input for the preprocessor.
< MOVE 11 TO XXX.
< MOVE 22 TO YYY.
< MOVE 33 TO ZZZ.

Lines starting with a '>' define the output expected from the preprocessor. 
> MOVE 11 TO XXX.
> MOVE 22 TO YYY.
> MOVE 33 TO ZZZ.

The test runner will feed the input lines through a preprocessor, capture the
output lines, and compare them to the expected output. The test will pass if
both are equal.

Important note: all lines are considered to be in FREE format. So there is no
need to bother with counting columns.
