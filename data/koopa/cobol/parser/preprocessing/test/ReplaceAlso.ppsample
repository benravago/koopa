This tests that a REPLACE ALSO leaves previous REPLACEs intact.

Default state has no active replacements.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE XXX TO YYY.



This will activate replacement of XXX.
< REPLACE ==XXX== BY ==FOO==.
> 

< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE FOO TO YYY.



This will ALSO activate replacement of YYY.
Replacement of XXX should still be active.
< REPLACE ALSO ==YYY== BY ==FUM==.
> 

< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE FOO TO FUM.



We should be able to override existing replacements.
< REPLACE ALSO ==XXX== BY ==FEE==.
> 

< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE FEE TO FUM.



This cancels all replacements.
< REPLACE OFF.
> 

< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE XXX TO YYY.
