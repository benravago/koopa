What if we REPLACE ALSO without any active REPLACEs ?

Default state has no active replacements.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE XXX TO YYY.



This will ALSO activate replacement of XXX !?
< REPLACE ALSO ==XXX== BY ==FOO==.
> 

It should just act like a normal REPLACE, really.
< MOVE XXX TO YYY.
> MOVE FOO TO YYY.
